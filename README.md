# School Management System 

##  Introduction / Overview

**School Management System** is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the management of students, teachers, parents, classes, lessons, exams, attendance, and more. It provides dedicated dashboards for **admin**, **teachers**, **students**, and **parents**, enabling efficient communication, data management, and real-time updates across the school ecosystem.

The system leverages modern web technologies and a robust database schema to ensure scalability, security, and ease of use for all stakeholders.
